Capstone Project 4 : Unsupervised - Zomato restaurant Clustering and Sentiment Analysis

This project aims to analyze the Zomato customers reviews and ratings for the restaurants in Hyderabad, and to provide insights into the basic trends, cost-benefit trade-offs, and customer sentiments. The project uses the following steps:

# 1. Basic EDA on restaurant data and reviews data:
This step involves exploring the data set to understand the distribution of ratings, reviews, cuisines, costs, collections, and other features of the restaurants. This step also involves cleaning and preprocessing the data for further analysis.

# 2. Visualization using different charts: 
This step involves creating various charts and graphs to visualize the data and identify the patterns and relationships among the features. Some of the charts that can be used are bar charts, pie charts, box plots, scatter plots, heat maps, etc.

# 3. Hypothesis testing: 
This step involves testing some hypotheses or assumptions about the data using statistical methods. For example, testing whether the average rating of a restaurant is different from a certain value, or whether the cost of a restaurant is related to its rating or cuisine type.

# 4. Feature engineering for clustering and sentiment analysis:
This step involves creating new features or transforming existing features to make them suitable for clustering and sentiment analysis. For example, c scaling numerical features, extracting keywords or topics from reviews, etc.

# 5. Clustering analysis using k-means and agglomerative: 
This step involves applying k-means and agglomerative clustering algorithms to group the restaurants based on their cost and rating performance. This step can help to identify the optimal segments of restaurants that offer high value or low value to the customers.

# 6. Sentiment analysis on reviews: 
This step involves applying sentiment analysis techniques to classify the reviews into positive, negative, and neutral sentiments. This step can help to understand the customer feedback and satisfaction towards the restaurants.

The project can help the restaurants to improve their service quality, menu offerings, and customer satisfaction based on the feedback from the customers.
